# Password-Generator-V2
A simple Python password generator and logger.

To install the required libraries, open a CMD prompt at the location of the install, and run the following: <br>
pip install -r requirements.txt

Simply download the files, and run main.py (Note: you will need to run the script with CMD, VSCode, Jupyter, ETC...)

This will create a file called 'passwords.txt' in the same folder as the main script

Within the passwords.txt file it will log all the generated passwords, and their entered uses.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

Storing passwords as plaintext is a considerable cybersecurity liability.
Strongly consider keeping the files for this script in a hidden, encrypted, or otherwise secure location.
I am not responsible for the breach of any accounts should someone gain access to your 'passwords.txt' file.
Store passwords at your own risk
