# Password-Generator-V2
A simple Python password generator and logger.

Simply download the files, and run main.py (Note: you will need to run the script with CMD, VSCode, Jupyter, ETC...)

This will create a file called 'passwords.txt' in the same folder as the main script

Within the passwords.txt file it will log all the generated passwords, and their entered uses.
